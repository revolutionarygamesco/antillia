    first: |
      Winter solstice. Two years ago today the world ended. The Abyss opened
      and the Scourge fell upon us. It is no longer sugar or spice that drives
      the world mad, but ash — and the Caribbean is the only place where it can
      be found. For now, at least. How long will it be before the Scourge
      spreads to burn the whole world to ash?

    corruption:
      title: Allegations of Corruption Against {governor}
      report: |
        <p><strong>Language:</strong> The report is written in {lang}.</p>
        <p><strong>Allegations:</strong> {crime}</p>
      evidence:
        solid: all of the documents needed to prove
        testimony: testimony from several key witnesses alleging
        hearsay: a collection of rumors suggesting
      crimes:
        skimming: |
          The report provides {evidence} that {governor} is underreporting
          customs collected and keeping the difference for himself.
        selling-offices: |
          The report provides {evidence} that {governor} is auctioning off
          positions like harbor master, customs inspector, and town magistrate
          to the highest bidder.
        embezzlement: |
          Soldiers die all the time in the Caribbean — from disease, from the
          Scourge, sometimes even in battle. When that happens, not all
          governors report the loss as they ought. The dead soldier continues
          to be paid his wage wage, but it all goes directly into the
          governor’s personal coffers. This report provides {evidence} that
          {governor} is engaged in just such a scheme.
        ash: |
          Defending settlements from the Scourge is dangerous, but it can also
          be a lucrative source of ash from all of the undead that are
          destroyed in the process each night. The governor is
          <em>supposed</em> to send that back to the Old World in regular
          shipments — but instead, this report provides {evidence} that
          {governor} has employed a network of his own sellers to distribute
          it on the local black market.
        arms: |
          The report provides {evidence} that {governor} is selling munitions,
          gunpowder, and even cannons supplied for the defense of the colony to
          anyone willing to buy and keeping the profits for himself.
        privateers: |
          The report provides {evidence} that {governor} is issuing letters of
          marque to pirates who offer him a sufficient cut of their profits.
        pardons: |
          The report provides {evidence} that {governor} is selling pardons to
          pirates and other criminals who offer sufficient bribes.
        probate: |
          The report provides {evidence} that {governor} is manipulating the
          probate courts to seize the estates of deceased merchants.
        illegal-trade: |
          The report provides {evidence} that {governor} is engaging in illegal
          trade with {empire}.
        extortion-scourge: |
          The report provides {evidence} that {governor} is refusing to protect
          settlements from the Scourge unless they pay him exorbitant bribes.
        extortion-pirates: |
          The report provides {evidence} that {governor} is refusing to protect
          settlements from pirates unless they pay him exorbitant bribes.
        harboring: |
          The report provides {evidence} that {governor} is harboring
          necromancers, sorcerers, and others who can control the undead. In
          exchange for his protection, they not only protect him and his
          properties from the Scourge, but even direct them towards his
          enemies, rivals, and anyone else who challenges him.
        imprisonment: |
          The report provides {evidence} that {governor} is jailing wealthy
          citizens on trumped-up charges until they can pay his exorbitant
          “fines.”

      reactions:
        ignore: |
          The authorities ignored the problem, hoping that it would resolve
          itself.
        prayer: |
          Religious authorities responded by calling for prayer and fasting.
        fumigation: |
          The townspeople have responded with extensive fumigation, burning
          {fumigants}, splashing vinegar on every surface they can find, and
          distributing smelling bottles filled with camphor and aromatic herbs.
        quarantine: |
          Civil authorities responded by marking the houses of the afflicted
          and forbidding them from leaving their homes unless and until they
          could be verified as healthy by a physician.
        closure: |
          The authorities responded by shutting down the local markets.
      twists:
        faith-healer: |
          A faith healer named {name} is reputed to have miraculously cured
          dozens of individuals afflicted with the disease.
        doctor: |
          A skilled physician named {name} worked tirelessly to save as many
          lives as possible.
        witch-hunt: |
          Accusations are made that certain members of the community used black
          magic to spread the disease, sparking a witch hunt.
        price-gouging: |
          Certain merchants take advantage of the situation by raising prices.
        authorities-fled: |
          The authorities have fled the town for fear of catching the disease,
          leaving it in a lawless state.
        undefended: |
          The disease has fallen most heavily on the garrison and militia,
          leaving the settlement virtually undefended.
        slave: |
          An African healer is applying some unorthodox techniques that have
          proven surprisingly effective for those patients willing to be
          treated by a slave.
      situations:
        early: |
          The report describes the early days of an outbreak of {disease} in
          {settlement} in {month} {year}. Several individuals had contracted
          the disease, with fear spreading that whatever miasma had fallen upon
          them would soon take the entire settlement.
        mid: |
          The report describes an outbreak of {disease} in {settlement} in
          {month} {year}. At the time of writing, the disease was running
          rampant throughout the settlement, claiming new victims with each
          passing day.
        late: |
          The report describes an outbreak of {disease} in {settlement} in
          {month} {year}. The miasma had fallen on the settlement weeks
          earlier, burning through the population. At this point, the people
          hope that it may soon lift, and they can begin rebuilding.
