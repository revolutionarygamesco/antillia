        observation: |
          I have carefully watched the comings and goings at the fort for
          several weeks now, and have seen enough to confidently report
        money: |
          I have observed ledgers and followed up with local merchants and

          <p>{evidence} that the walls of {fort} are being rebuilt with coral

              and these chambers have been stocked with @UUID[Actor.h7zfo0id60XazmVT].
              If the garrison believes that all is lost, a lever can be pulled
              to release these skeletons, ensuring that if they cannot maintain
              control of the fort then no one will.</p>
