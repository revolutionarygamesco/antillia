    title: Adventure Log
    first: |
      Winter solstice. Two years ago today the world ended. The Abyss opened
      and the Scourge fell upon us. It is no longer sugar or spice that drives
      the world mad, but ash — and the Caribbean is the only place where it can
      be found. For now, at least. How long will it be before the Scourge
      spreads to burn the whole world to ash?

        observation: |
          I have carefully watched the comings and goings at the fort for
          several weeks now, and have seen enough to confidently report
        money: |
          I have observed ledgers and followed up with local merchants and
          other purveyors, enough to deduce
