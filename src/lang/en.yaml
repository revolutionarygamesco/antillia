    title: Adventure Log
    first: |
      Winter solstice. Two years ago today the world ended. The Abyss opened
      and the Scourge fell upon us. It is no longer sugar or spice that drives
      the world mad, but ash — and the Caribbean is the only place where it can
      be found. For now, at least. How long will it be before the Scourge
      spreads to burn the whole world to ash?
