        <p>Think of fire in terms of adjacent zones. If you’re using a map
          with five-foot squares, then think of each square as a zone. If
          you’re not using such a map, keep track of the zones that the fire
          might spread to. Think of the fire in each zone as its own,
          independent fire when it comes to spreading, going out, or being
          put out.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Origin point:</strong> The fire starts in a particular zone.</li>
          <li><strong>Water:</strong> Throw a bucket of water on a zone that’s on
            fire to put out the fire in that zone.</li>
          <li><strong>Smother:</strong> Test Agility DR 12 to smother the fire in
            a zone.</li>
          <li><strong>Burning:</strong> Something that’s burning takes [[/r 1d6]]
            damage.</li>
          <li><strong>Spreading:</strong> Each round, each zone that’s on fire
            @UUID[RollTable.zdm2uK2nh1052TQL]{could spread} to an adjacent
            zone.</li>
          <li><strong>Barrel of Gunpowder:</strong> If a barrel of gunpowder
            burns, it explodes. If you’re within 15 feet, test Agility DR 12
            to take [[/r 3d6]] damage or take [[/r 6d6]] damage. If you’re
            between 15 and 30 feet away, test Agility DR 12 or take [[/r 3d6]]
            damage. Everything within that area is now on fire.</li>
          <li><strong>Magazine:</strong> If the fire reaches the magazine, the
            entire ship explodes. Anyone who’s in a position to jump overboard
            can test Agility DR 12 to save their lives. Everyone else on board
            is killed instantly by the blast.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Something that’s burning takes [[/r 1d6]] damage. That means a
            person that’s on fire takes that damage. If a ship is on fire, it
            takes that damage, though the 1:5 damage scaling mentioned on p. 73
            applies here, so your sloop with 30 HP has 150 HP for this. Don’t
            let that lure you into a false sense of security, though; when
            you’ve got 20 zones on board on fire and you’re taking 20d6 damage
            every round, you’re going to go down quick.</li>
          <li>Since you treat each zone as its own fire, when you put out the
            fire in one zone, there may still be fires burning in others.</li>
          <li>If you don’t have something to smother the fire with, you can
            try to stop, drop, and roll, but that means getting burned, and
            that means taking [[/r 1d6]] damage.</li>
          <li>If a creature is on fire, that fire can spread to the zone
            they’re in just like any other fire. Unlike any other fire, that
            creature can move, spreading the fire a lot more quickly than
            usual.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When someone falls overboard, you can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Just narrate what happens (usually that person is lost to Davy
            Jones’s locker).</li>
          <li>Resolve it quickly with a few dice rolls (<em>see</em>
            <strong>Quick Version</strong>).</li>
          <li>Zoom in on it and make it a full encounter (<em>see</em>
            <strong>Encounter</strong>).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sharks</h2>
        <p>It’s not just your bad luck that you
          always happen to fall overboard when sharks are near. Sharks have
          learned that tasty things fall off ships all the time, and trail
          behind them hoping for just such an opportunity. Use the 
          @UUID[Macro.4QefoHlHz8SQCOvh]{Feeding Frenzy macro} to determine
          how many (and what kind of) sharks are trailing your ship when it
          matters.</p>
        <h2>Quick Version</h2>
        <p><strong>Swim:</strong> A conscious person in the water can swim back
          to the ship by testing Agility DR 10 (plus complications).</p>
        <p><strong>Rescue:</strong> Anyone who is near the gunwale on the side
          the person fell (port or starboard) can throw a line and test
          Strength DR 10 to pull the person aboard (plus complications).</p>
        <p><strong>Sharks:</strong> If they’re conscious, the person can
          attempt to swim back. Then anyone who’s in position can attempt to
          throw a line, but if each of those fail and the person is still in
          the water, the sharks arrive, and each one attacks.</p>
        <table>
          <caption>Overboard Complications</caption>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Complication</th>

            <tr>

              <td>DR +2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Ship is moving at full speed.</td>
              <td>DR +4</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>You’re in the middle of a storm.</td>

          </tbody>
        </table>
        <h2>Encounter</h2>
        <p>You can play out the situation as a full encounter. Set up a map
          with the ship, the person overboard in the water, and everyone on the
          ship. Use the @UUID[Macro.4QefoHlHz8SQCOvh]{Feeding Frenzy macro} to
          determine the number and kinds of sharks following the ship and place
          each of them on the map, then play it out in rounds as you would any
          other encounter.</p>
        <p><strong>Ship movement:</strong> If the ship continues to move, it
          moves a number of feet each round equal to its speed &times; 10. So a
          sloop (speed 5) at full speed moves forward 50 feet each turn, though
          if it’s moving at half-speed it would only be 25. If the order is
          given to drop anchor, it will take five rounds to stop the ship. Each
          round, move the ship and everyone on it the appropriate distance.</p>
        <p><strong>Swimming:</strong> If you know how to swim (and most pirates
          don’t; falling overboard is often considered a death sentence so many
          consider it useless to learn how to swim), test Agility DR 10 to swim
          your speed (DR 14 during a storm).</p>
        <p><strong>Throwing a line:</strong> Anyone on the ship can throw a
          line to someone in the water if they’re less than 30 feet away. Once
          they have it, the person on board holding the line can test Strength
          DR 10 (or DR 14 in a storm) to pull them 30 feet closer to the ship.
          While holding on to the line, the person in the water moves forward
          with the ship.</p>
