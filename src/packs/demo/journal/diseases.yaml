        <p><em>Pirate Borg</em> has some nice, simple rules for sickness on
          p. 31, but with specific tropical diseases being such a critical part
          of life in the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, we’ve added
          some other rules that you can use. There are some elements in our
          random tables that refer to these, but you can always fall back to
          the standard rules for sickness if you prefer to keep things
          simple.</p>
        <p><strong>Exposure:</strong> When you’re exposed to the disease,
          you’ll make a test (usually Toughness) to see if you get sick. If
          someone on board the ship has a contagious disease, you’ve definitely
          been exposed to it. Only count one exposure per disease per day.</p>
        <p><strong>Effect:</strong> The toll that the disease takes per long
          rest. The standard is losing [[/r d6]] HP instead of regaining HP.</p>
        <p><strong>Long Rest:</strong> <em>Pirate Borg</em> specifies that a
          “long rest” is <em>overnight</em>, but the watch system had pirates
          typically working and resting in four-hour shifts, so you get a
          “long rest” if you’re able to get 8 hours of rest during a 24-hour
          period, even if that’s broken up by work shifts or other activity.
          You can only complete one long rest per 24-hour period.</p>
        <p><strong>Recovery:</strong> The character isn’t sick anymore. Until
          you recover, you’re still suffering the <strong>effect</strong> at
          least once a day (even if you don’t get a long rest).</p>
        <p><strong>Immunity:</strong> This varies from one disease to the next.
          Sometimes when you recover from a disease you get total, life-long
          immunity. Sometimes the immunity will last for some number of years
          or months. Sometimes it isn’t total immunity at all, just bonuses to
          the DR for exposure or recovery.</p>

        <p><em>Known today as yellow fever.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Exposure:</strong> When exposed, test Toughness DR 12 or
          become infected.</p>
        <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Fever, chills, muscle pain, headache,
          nausea, vomiting, fatigue, loss of appetite, yellow skin</p>
        <p><strong>Effect:</strong> At the end of each long rest, lose [[/r 2d6]]
          HP instead of recovering HP.</p>
        <p><strong>Recovery:</strong> Each time you lose HP from your infection,
          test Toughness DR 16 to end the infection.</p>
        <p><strong>Progress:</strong> Each time you fail a Toughness test to
          recover, take -1 DR to your next test.</p>
        <p><strong>Immunity:</strong> Once you recover from yellow jack, you
          can never get it again (you are, in local parlance, “seasoned”).</p>

          <h2>The Secret of Shivers</h2>
          <p>Shivers is caused by @UUID[Item.3T9WmCh6g8uMSsr0]{an arcane ritual}
            that binds the infected (and anyone they go on to infect) to the
            caster, channeling the heat of their bodies to the caster. It was
            first created by a coral shoggoth and has been circulated widely
            amongst them. For coral shoggoths, this transfer of body heat
            translates directly to HP — every HP that an infected person loses
            to shivers, the shoggoth gains.</p>
          <p>If shivers is contracted by some other means, the illness
            magically connects itself to the nearest shoggoth and begins
            transferring the victim’s body heat to it.</p>
          <p>Killing the creature that’s receiving the victims’ body heat will
            cause everyone that creature was draining to recover.</p>
          <p>A player character might know this with a Presence DR 18 test.</p>

        <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Fever, sweating, intense desire to

        <p><strong>Effect:</strong> At the end of each long rest, roll

          First it affects the hands or feet, then the lower arm or leg,
