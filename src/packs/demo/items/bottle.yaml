  description: |
    <p>An onion-shaped bottle made of dark olive-green blown glass, slightly
      irregular with a rough pontil scar on the base. These bottles are almost
      always produced in England and imported to the Caribbean, which has
      little glass-blowing industry of its own. Bottles like this are somewhat
      valuable in their own right, even when empty. They are usually refilled,
      reused, and repaired with wax or pitch if they’re cracked.</p>
